============================

In ASP.NET Core, background tasks can be implemented as hosted services. A hosted service is a class with background task logic that implements the IHostedService interface. This topic provides three hosted service examples:

 - **Background task that runs on a timer.**
 - Hosted service that activates a scoped service. The scoped service can use dependency injection (DI).
 - Queued background tasks that run sequentially.
